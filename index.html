			<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
			<section class="typed">
				<p>Generic Logo Company strives to enhance your company's brand recognition and increase your sales pipeline. Compete fairly with mega-corporations who have massive marketing budgets without matching their expense.</p>

							<p>Maria, our very first client, had this to say: </p>
						</td>
						<td>
							<p><q>Our product was a hit with investors, but when it came time to go to market, sales stalled. Nobody heard of us so naturally we were being overlooked by bigger competitors. With GenCom's knowledgable and friendly staff, our product was exploding on every social media site! Sales grew tenfold within weeks thanks to a new, exciting logo and effective advertising to the audiences most interested in products like ours. If you face the same challenges I did, GenCom will not disappoint.</q></p>
						</td>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<p>Here's testimony from another Genevangelist, Osmond:</p>
						</td>
						<td>
							<p><q>Generic Logo Company went above and beyond to overhaul my crude brand logo into a highly-renowned and easily-recognizable product. Now we are on track to dethrone the #1 brand in the market. This would not be possible without GenCom's expert and honest services.</q></p>
